Okay we're rebooting the Chess 2 project
AGAIN
AGAIN
AGAIN
I'm going insane

Anyway, let's try to do it properly this time
What ar we building?
A custom-made Chess website, with my own customized pieces
How do we make this?
We need 3 main components;
- Chess engine
- API layer
- Frontend

Each layer depends on the prior, and we avoid backwards dependencies
Cool.
I guess we start out with the Chess engine?
